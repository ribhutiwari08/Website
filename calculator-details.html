        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project showcases my skills and previous work as a python Developer. The main technologies used are Python.</p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>I developed the Calculator GUI using Python's Tkinter library, which provides tools for
             creating graphical user interfaces. The layout was designed with buttons for digits and operations,
              and I used event handling to perform arithmetic calculations. The application ensures real-time calculation 
              as users input numbers and select operations, providing a seamless user experience..</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Event Handling and Button Mapping: Mapping each button to its respective function
             (digit, operator, clear, etc.) required careful planning to ensure that the
              correct event was triggered for each button press.</p>
